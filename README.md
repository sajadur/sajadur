I am a Java Web Developer working as a freelancer, and I am deeply passionate about Java and JVM technologies.

My experience primarily involves developing software designs as a software architect, microservice design, server architecture design, database design, and large-scale software design. I am adept at writing automated tests and effectively communicating with business stakeholders and leading team members.

I have successfully designed internet banking software for three banks, with one of our projects being the most widely used internet banking software in my country.

As a quick learner, I dedicate my spare time to working on personal projects, problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode, and learning about large-scale systems.

I am highly committed to my tasks, take ownership of my work, and am known for being a good listener.

For a detailed overview of my skill set, here's a summary of my experience:

- Software Design, Database Design, and Microservices Architecture
- Java Web Framework with Spring MVC and JSP
- Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Cloud
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx, HA-Proxy
- AWS
